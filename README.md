# employee_bonus_sales_analysis-northern_traders
This project features an SQL query designed to identify the top 5 employees with the highest sales orders for bonus distribution. The query joins multiple tables (Employees, Orders, OrderDetails, and Products), calculates total sales per order, and filters for the highest-value orders using the HAVING clause.
